This project demonstrates 4 basic React functionalities:

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Counter Component

- Two buttons: Increment and Decrement.
- Displays the current count.

### 2. User Data Fetch

- Displays a loading message during fetch.
- Renders a list of user names once loaded.

### 3. Input Field & Button
- Tracks input value using `useState`.
